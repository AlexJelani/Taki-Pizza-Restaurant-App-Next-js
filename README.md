This is my personal project of a restaurant that offers pizza. There is a navigation bar with a logo, number, company name and tabs. There is a homepage with an attractive promotion. There is a section about the company in which its vision and activities are described. There is a menu section where we can check what pizza is currently being served along with prices and ingredients. There is also a contact section, where we can check the company's location, opening hours and contact number. We also have a social media footer.

The application is fully responsive for all types of devices. It has smooth transitions between sections. The navigation bar is adapted to mobile devices.

I have also implemented a 3D pizza model on the homepage.

Technology used: React.js, ReactThreeFiber, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Next.js.

I added the ability to add products to the cart, increase the quantity, reduce the quantity and delete. The user can go to his basket and proceed to payment, where he will also provide delivery details.
